# First day installations

## Learning objectives

- Complete all installations necessary to begin the program.

### Estimated time: 0.75h

## Description

In this lesson you will double-check that you have installed all tools that will be necessary to learn in the first weeks.

In the following modules we will ask you to install additional tools but only when you need them to complete specific lessons and projects.

### Why is it important?

Very soon you will start coding your first projects. Having all of the tools set up ahead of time will save you time.

### First day installation list

From day one , you need to make sure that you have installed:

- A text editor. I recommend the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but it can be Atom, Sublime, or any text editor of your preference.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
- [Configure your GitHub account to use your SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) so that you can push your code to GitHub quickly.

**Additional note:**

If you use Atom or VSCode, you might be tempted to use plugins such as TeleType or VS Live Share to work on the same files with your coding partner. However, remember that it's incredibly important that you invest time in mastering Git, and getting used to following the commit/push/pull workflow every time you work with your coding partner will help you get really good at it.

## Additional materials

**These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, here are some resources to help you. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.**

- Get a quick introduction and play around with some of the most common [bash commands](https://www.educative.io/blog/bash-shell-command-cheat-sheet).
