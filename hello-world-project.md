# Set up a "Hello world" project

## Learning Objectives

- Create branches with different base branches.
- Understand the concept of version control.
- Follow GitHub flow.
- Open pull requests in GitHub.
- Write descriptive, easy to understand commit messages.
- Write short, detailed, easy to understand descriptions of pull requests.
- Write a descriptive and easy to understand README in business English for every project submitted.
- Demonstrate an ability to submit a project for code review.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

In this project, you will set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding is required for this exercise.
Your goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices you learned about in previous steps.
You will be using them in all projects and most likely in your future job as well, so it is important to know them!

IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.\*

### General requirements

Once you finish your project, double-check to make sure your repo is ready:

### Requirements

- Remember to document your work
- Create a new GitHub repo.
- Create a new branch according to the
- Add a `.gitignore` file.
- Add descriptive README file to your project -
- Add 3 files (each one in a separate commit):
- A .html file that includes a header with the text "Hello Microverse!". Use `h1` tag for that.
- A .css file that includes one class with styles for your header (make it in your favorite color).
- A test.md file with the text "This file should be ignored by git".
- Make sure that the last file is actually ignored by git and is not present in your GitHub repository.
- Open a pull request.

**You will learn more about the code review process in upcoming lessons. For now, it is enough if you follow those steps.**
