## Description

Every website can be opened on different devices and those devices have different screen sizes.
With responsive web design (RWD) you can create one design and it will automatically adapt itself based on the screen size of the device that you are using to load the webpage.

### Why is it important?

Nowadays business owners want to reach out to users on different devices - phones, tablets, and computers. You as a web developer should be ready to fulfill those requests. Building and maintaining a separate website for each screen size is not the best solution in general.
