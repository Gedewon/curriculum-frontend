# Flexbox

## Learning objectives

- Use Flexbox to place elements in the page.

### Estimated time: 2.5h

## Description

Flexbox is a layout tool in CSS that helps you easily position HTML elements on the page. To use it apply the `display: flex` property to the container element of the content that you want to lay out.

### Why is Flexbox important?

When you do work on the front-end it is your responsibility to transform a web design into a web page. Most of the time you are asked to stick to the given design as much as possible so that the web page looks exactly like the design. One way to arrange HTML elements using CSS is to use a layout tool like Flexbox or CSS Grid to arrange them. In the program we will review multiple different layout tools like CSS Grid, but Flexbox is the most popular layout tool and one that is important for you to learn in order to be a competent front-end developer.
