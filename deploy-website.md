### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn how to deploy a simple website using GitHub Pages.

### Why is software deployment important?

Once you have finished developing an application, you should make it available for your users over the internet. Software deployment (or simply _deploy_) comprises all the activities needed to make available a software system, from developers to users. It's a complex process that includes several steps, in continuous feedback (build, test, deploy, build...). There is not a single way to deploy an application - it depends on the type, size, and complexity of your app, on your technology stack and environment, and finally on the _place_, the provider (GitHub, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.) you choose to deploy on.

### GitHub Pages

in this program you will learn about different deployment tools. In this lesson we will start with GitHub Pages, a simple but powerful way to deploy your application. Its main advantages are:

- It's free
- It's easy and fast to start
- It's totally integrated with GitHub
- Works perfectly with small and static applications
- It has integration with a lot of tools
