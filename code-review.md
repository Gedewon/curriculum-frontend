# Code review flow at the program

## Learning objectives

- Understand the standard code review process with GitHub pull requests.
- Understand the Program code review flow.

### Estimated time: 0.25h

## Description

At every job we use [the standard code review process with GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/features/code-review/).

Therefore, once you have your pull request ready,request for review. This lesson shows you step-by-step what needs to happen.

### Why is it important?

You will be using this flow in all your projects. I recommend keeping this list open while working on your first projects. In later projects you should remember it without needing to look at the list for each project.
